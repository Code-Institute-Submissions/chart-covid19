## Unit Testing

### Data Load Read Data test using Chrome Dev tool console.log

- Validate Data Elements and selected random records from the data source and validate data load promise object records

![NYTimes Covid Data](assets/testIssues/nytimesdatacsv.png)

![Console log Data elements](assets/testIssues/dataconsolelog.png)

![Console log Sample records](assets/testIssues/samplerecords.png)

- Validate computed values domain required for scaling charts using D3

### Monitor Dynamic Data Process and Rendering

- Deployed the website to Git Pages and monitor changes in chart data daily to validate the data is updated as released by the data source
- Review data source notes for disruptions in the trends
  For example, [The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/state/massachusetts) reported that on September 2, 2020, MA reported that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE.
  This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.

## Test Driven Development D3

- Utilize console.log to display variable values using Dev tool when adding components and attributes
- Validate addition by rendering the webpage and inspecting to confirm expected outcome

## Website Behavior on different Browsers and Screen Size

- Website is developed to render using Firefox and Chrome
- CSS Grid not compatible with other browsers and older versions
- Columns will display side by side on screen sizes 600px and greater. Columns will be stacked for screen size less than 600px
- Chart are zoomable using browser zoom function utilizing built-in gestures available on mobile devices and browser settings on other devices
- Maps have interactive zoom and pan functions on all screen sizes

## Bug Resolution

### Page Scrolling not enabled

![Page Scrolling not enabled](assets/testIssues/unableToScrollPagewith2svgs.jpg)

Solution:

- Remove CSS attribute overflow: hidden for the HTML body element

```
body {
  margin: 0px;
  /* overflow: hidden; */
}
```

### Deployment on GitHub pages â€“ 404 issues

Solution:

- Created a repo in GitHub and generated a Gitpod workspace without using the CI template
- Copied all my files from VSCode on my local machine to the Gitpod repo and pushed it to GitHub
- Enabled Github pages and everything rendered.

  Note: It appears it circumvented the file path issues and resolved the 404 unable to load resource issues

### D3 SVG with CSS Grid not responsive

Unable to make D3 SVG responsive with CSS GRID
Resolved: SVG element needs width and height in conjunction with viewBox

![D3 SVG with CSS Grid not responsive](assets/testIssues/d3SVGCSSGridNotResponsive.png)

Solution:

- Source Credit: D3 Slack Community post by Mike Lambert Sep 10th at 2:21 PM

In conjunction with viewBox, you need to have max-width: 100% and/or height: auto on your SVG

- Researched and attempted solutions
  - User Bootstrap Grid
  - Autoprefixer
  - Utilize SVG viewBox instead of SVG width and height
  - Applied CSS Autoprefixer

### D3 Line Chart Time Axis Tick Labels Overlapping

Labels for the months start to overlap as more data is released

Solution:  
 Use abbreviated month name format for time axis tick labels

```
const xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale).tickSize(-innerHeight).tickPadding(15).tickFormat(d3.timeFormat("%b"));
```

![lineChartTimeAxisLabelOverlap](assets/testIssues/lineChartTimeAxisLabelOverlap.png)
![lineChartTimeAxisLabelOverlapFix](assets/testIssues/lineChartTimeAxisLabelOverlapFix.png)

```
  width: -webkit-fit-content;
  width: -moz-fit-content;
  width: fit-content;
```

## Known Limitations

- x-axis tick labels will collide with more data so that there is not sufficient space to accommodate the label length. A future fix is to display the tick labels at an angle and reduce the font size
