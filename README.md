# Chart Covid19 Pandemic Cases

Interactive Chart to display the trend of the number of Covid19 cases by US County during the pandemic. The data is provided by the New York Times and updated daily and automatically reflected in a chart usingD3 Data-Driven Documents.

The idea is to report realtime data with a simple focus on Covid19 cases trends by US counties for a general audience. It is not a professional chart or dashboard for an audience interested in in-depth analysis.

The user will be able to select a specific point in time to display the counts at that time. The purpose is to allow users to view the trend as information that may trigger curiosity and support decision making. Engaging as many people with one useful piece of information is vital to individual response to COVID19 in a situation of pandemic information overload.
